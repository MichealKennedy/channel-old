	<p class="intro">Our mission: To sail all over the world, off the grid, surviving off the sea and land, living as frugally and freely for as long as possible.</p>

<p>We're depressed and dissatisfied with our lives. So we're buying a sailboat, and with little sailing experience, attempting to frugally sail around the world.
</p>

<p>Each episode will follow us (Mike and Michelle) as we sail, explore places, and try to survive off the grid. To supplement the food and water we have, we will fish, eat seaweed, and hike for hours into the bear and cougar infested woods to find freshwater, plants and berries. We will build our own shelters, build primitive tools; collect, filter, and purify water; cut our own hair; etc.
</p>

<p>Through trial and error we will battle weather, dangerous wild animals, hunger, dehydration, sickness, running aground, isolation, language barriers, pirates, uncharted waters, and more. We'll stumble across isolated villages and towns, and couchsurf in cities all over the world. Each day will be a test of our relationship, our skills, and of our commitment to our ultimate goal: to travel around the world for as frugally and as long as possible.
