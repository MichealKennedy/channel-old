	<h2 class="pageTitle">Our Plan</h2>

	<p class="intro">Our Mission: To move onto a sailboat, live 100% off the grid and off the sea and land, and to live on as little money per month as possible.</p></p>

<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Once moved onto our sailboat, we’ll stock up on cheap bulk foods like oats and rice. Then we’ll spend our days fishing, foraging, growing sprouts and other produce aboard. Work exchanges, use money from things we make and sell. We’re gonna investigate getting surplus food from restaurants that would otherwise have gone to the garbage.</p></p>

<h3>Water</h3>
<p>We’ll catch and filter rainwater and seawater; fill up 2L water bottles at fast-food restaurants, mall bathrooms, public fountains. Perhaps a watermaker someday.</p>

<h3>Electricity</h3>
<p>We’ll get solar panels for the boat, possibly a wind turbine. We’ll use cafes and restaurants to charge up sometimes. Portable backpack solar panel. Hand-cranked blenders, wind-up radios. A small back-up generator.</p>

<h3>Rent</h3>
<p>When we buy our sailboat, we’ll anchor out as much as possible, or find the cheapest marina we can find. We’ll couchsurf when we’re in cities for a few days. Work exchange (WWOOF, Workaway, HelpX, etc.).</p>

<h3>Internet/Phones/Communication</h3>
Phone data (Wind Unlimited) while on the boat in Vancouver. At cafes and restaurants while under way. Perhaps satellite internet someday.

<h3>Transportation</h3>
<p>Our boat and dinghy will be our main transportation. Then our bikes. And then public transit.</p>

<h3>Medication</h3>
<p>Michelle has ulcerative colitis, which used to cost us about $200/month, but now Mike’s job benefits covers it. When we travel, we’ll make sure to have extra money to last us at least a year.</p>
